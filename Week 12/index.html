<!-- We hate that we couldn't get our code working really at all. We get the principals but we couldn't make
 it all function in time. Originally our idea was to have a mini-monster-collector type deal where there were
 aspects, monsters, and teams. Teams had several monsters and a leader, and the monsters had an aspect, and 
 the aspect had one aspect it was strong and weak against. This was absolutely more than we could chew. so next
 time we'll crush it, but we guess healing up from thumb surgery took a lot out of us and we spent most of this
 week (and the holiday break) recovering (and suffering before the surgery, respectively.)-->
