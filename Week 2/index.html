<main> TE@L is the internet's new premier spot for the objectively correct explanation.<br>
No, More than simply that, an entire ocean of beautiful prose carefully deconstructing<br>
and examining the subjects of elusivity is here to be swam in. No longer will thoughts<br>
of confusion or disbelief plague your mind during sleepless nights.

<!-- WILDLY important, and not mentioned elsewhere we don't think but
DIV will merge its contents requested css, but doing a class inline
will overwrite it. We're sure there's a more techinacal way of saying
that, but observe the football and homestuck page's link back to index.
The one that has DIV has the a element glow effect alongside the italics,
but the one without has only the wows shadow effect.-->
<!--TO DO: Style everything using class D, id D, and element D-->
